"""Verify the PACKAGED bytes now carry every source's own JLPT level.

Reads the archive, not the renderer, so this proves what a user installs. For
each of the 319 conflicting entries it walks the term-bank card and checks that
every (source, level) pair the DATASET attributes is visible inside that source's
own disclosure -- and that the compact badge is still exactly one line.

The thirteen-source corpus has 319 conflicting entries. Their per-source values
are preserved by the unified merge and must all be visible in the packaged card.
