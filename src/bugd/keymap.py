"""Cross-source grammar-point matching: which source rows are the SAME point?

This module is the single authority for cross-source alignment. It reads the
normalized per-source artifacts in `data/extracted/*.json` and emits
`data/merge/keymap.json`: an explicit assignment of every source row to a
canonical grammar point, plus a report of the ambiguous cases and exactly why
each was folded or refused.

The design bias is asymmetric on purpose. A missed fold shows the user the same
point twice, which is untidy. A wrong fold silently merges two different grammar
points into one card and *destroys* a distinction the source authors made
deliberately. So every rule below either folds on positive attested evidence or
refuses, and no similarity score is ever allowed to outvote a refusal.

Pipeline, in order:

1. **Partition.** Scope every row by `(variety, era)` (`bugd.axes`). Rows that
   disagree are never candidates, so no later rule can fold a classical 如し onto
   a modern ようだ. Register does *not* partition — measured against the corpus it
   is prose commentary about a point far more often than a property of it, and
   partitioning on it splits correct folds. It is recorded and reported instead.

2. **Demote producer-declared aliases.** 1,167 of 4,972 rows are the producers'
   own redirect/synthetic-lookup rows, not independent opinions. Counting them as
   corroboration would let one source appear to agree with itself. Demotion is
   proven lossless before it is applied: `donna_toki`'s 421 alias rows have empty
   bodies, and `nihongo_no_sensei`'s 746 synthetic rows are byte-identical to
   their own `canonicalExpression` row. They become lookup forms on the point they
   redirect to, never contributors.

3. **Collapse byte-identical rows.** A row's identity is
   `(source, source_id, substance_hash)`. `source_id` alone is *not* unique —
   edewakaru ships `も` eleven times as eleven different senses — so collapsing on
   it would destroy homographs. Collapsing on substance destroys nothing: all 91
   collisions are exact duplicates.

4. **Tier A — partition-scoped bijection.** When a normalized key is claimed by
   several sources and *each* contributes exactly one row, the sources are talking
   about one point: 558 groups. If any source contributes two or more rows to the
   key it is a homograph fan, the correspondence is ambiguous, and the group is
   refused (191 groups) and separated by a source-derived disambiguator.

5. **Tier B — attested variant links.** A producer naming another source's exact
   headword as a variant is evidence, but raw variant edges are unsafe: they
   include polarity flips (`ないことはある` / `ないことはない`) and generic hubs
   (`限りだ` -> `です`). Guarded down to reading-identity or reciprocal links with
   bounded in-degree, then restricted to strictly pairwise edges, 54 survive.
   Transitive closure is rejected outright — it merged 8 rows into one point.

The attachment signature (`bugd.signature`) is deliberately never a fold gate.
Requiring signature equality refuses 540 of 697 correct bijective folds, and
sub-matching inside refused buckets manufactures false ones (`て` "very" onto `て`
"because"). It is recorded as an observed attribute and used only to *separate*
rows that already collide.
