"""Merge stage: many per-source records -> one unified corpus.

The merge stage is the only place cross-source alignment policy lives. It groups
normalized `GrammarPoint` records into `MergedEntry` objects keyed by lookup
form, preserves every contributing source, and never silently discards a source's
substance.

Policy the implementing card must decide and encode here (not in extractors, not
in the bank generator):

* which normalization is applied before grouping (width, kana, okurigana,
  bracketed alternatives, trailing particles);
* deterministic ordering of contributing sources within one entry;
* variant/alias forms that must resolve to the same entry;
* de-duplication of learner-visible duplicates (identical example sentences
  arriving from two sources) as distinct from source-identity de-duplication;
* how conflicting JLPT levels or structures across sources are presented —
  shown side by side with attribution, never averaged or silently picked.
